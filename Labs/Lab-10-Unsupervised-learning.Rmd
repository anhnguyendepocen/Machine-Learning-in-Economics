# Principal Components

We will use `USArrests` data set which is a part of the base `R`.   
```{r} 
library(ISLR)
states <- row.names(USArrests) 
names(USArrests)
```


```{r}
apply(USArrests, 2, mean)
```

```{r}
apply(USArrests, 2, var) 
```

There are several packages to conduct PCA analysis (`prcomp`, `princomp`, etc.)
We standardize each variable using the option `scale=TRUE`
```{r}
pr.out <- prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
names(pr.out) 
```

The center and scale components correspond to the means and standard
deviations of the variables that were used for scaling prior to implementing
PCA.
```{r}
pr.out$center
```

```{r}
pr.out$scale
```

The `rotation` matrix provides the principal component loadings; each column
of `pr.out$rotation` contains the corresponding principal component
loading vector
```{r}
pr.out$rotation
```

Principle component score vectors: 
```{r}
dim(pr.out$x)  
```

We can plot the first two principal components as follows
```{r}
biplot(pr.out, scale=0, cex=0.6)
```

The `scale=0` argument to `biplot()` ensures that the arrows are scaled to 
represent the loadings; other values for scale give slightly different biplots
with different interpretations.

Notice that this figure is a mirror image of Figure 10.1. Recall that
the principal components are only unique up to a sign change, so we can
reproduce Figure 10.1 by making a few small changes
```{r}
pr.out$rotation <- -pr.out$rotation
pr.out$x <- -pr.out$x
biplot(pr.out, scale=0, cex=0.6)
```

Importance of principal components: 
```{r}
summary(pr.out)
```

We see that the first principal component explains 62.0% of the variance
in the data, the next principal component explains 24.7% of the variance,
and so forth.

```{r}
screeplot(pr.out, type="lines") 
```

```{r}
pr.out$sdev
pr.var <- pr.out$sdev^2
pr.var
pve <- pr.var/sum(pr.var)
pve
plot(pve, xlab="Principal Component", ylab="Proportion of Variance Explained", ylim=c(0,1),type='b')
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab="Principal Component", ylab="Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained", ylim=c(0,1),type='b')
```

## Example: Body Data 

We saw this data set in our previous classes. 

```{r}
load("../Data/body.RData") 
bodydata <- subset(body, select = -c(age, gender, gender_dummy)) 
str(bodydata)
```

Inspecting the correlation matrix we see that these features are highly correlated. 
```{r}
library(ggcorrplot)
cormat <- round(cor(bodydata), 2)
ggcorrplot(cormat, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower", outline.color = "white")
```
```{r}
pr.out <- prcomp(bodydata, scale=TRUE)
summary(pr.out)  
# change the signs of factor loadings
pr.out$rotation <- -pr.out$rotation
pr.out$x <- -pr.out$x
biplot(pr.out, scale=0, cex=0.6)
```

```{r} 
pr.var <- pr.out$sdev^2 
pve <- pr.var/sum(pr.var)
pve
plot(pve, xlab="Principal Component", ylab="Proportion of Variance Explained", ylim=c(0,1),type='b')
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab="Principal Component", ylab="Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained", ylim=c(0,1),type='b')
```

Approximately 85% of the total variation can be explained by the first 5 principal components. 


# K-Means Clustering 
The function `kmeans()` performs K-means clustering in R. We begin with
a simple simulated example in which there truly are two clusters in the
data: the first 25 observations have a mean shift relative to the next 25
observations.
```{r}
set.seed(2)
x <- matrix(rnorm(50*2), ncol=2)
x[1:25,1]=x[1:25,1]+3
x[1:25,2]=x[1:25,2]-4
km.out <- kmeans(x,2,nstart=20)
km.out$cluster
plot(x, col=(km.out$cluster+1), main="K-Means Clustering Results with K=2", xlab="", ylab="", pch=20, cex=2) 
```

In this example, we knew that there really were two clusters because
we generated the data. However, for real data, in general we do not know
the true number of clusters. We could instead have performed K-means
clustering on this example with K = 3.


```{r}
set.seed(4)
km.out <- kmeans(x,3,nstart=20)
km.out
plot(x, col=(km.out$cluster+1), main="K-Means Clustering Results with K=3", xlab="", ylab="", pch=20, cex=2)
```
When K = 3, K-means clustering splits up the two clusters.
It is strongly recommended to run K-means clustering with a large
value of nstart, such as 20 or 50, since otherwise an undesirable local
optimum may be obtained.

```{r}
set.seed(3)
km.out <- kmeans(x,3,nstart=1)
km.out$tot.withinss
km.out <- kmeans(x,3,nstart=20)
km.out$tot.withinss
```

## Example: Bodydata 

```{r}
km.out <- kmeans(bodydata,2,nstart=20)
plot(bodydata[,1:3],col=(km.out$cluster),cex=2)
```

Plot clustering based on weight and height and compare to the actual gender factor: 
```{r} 
# Large blank circles are the resulting clusters
plot(bodydata[,22:23],col=(km.out$cluster),cex=2)
# put dots inside circles representing observed gender
# red = men, black = women
points(body[,23:24], col=c(1,2)[body$gender], pch=19, cex=1)
```
```{r} 
observed_class <- c(1,2)[body$gender]
km_cluster <- km.out$cluster
ratio <- sum(observed_class == km_cluster)/nrow(bodydata)
ratio
```

84% of observations seem to be clustered correctly. Note that if know the clusters 
we'd not apply K-Means cluster method. THis was just for demonstration purposes. 
When we know the labels there are better classification methods which we've discussed in our previous classes. 

# Hierarchical Clustering 

The `hclust()` function implements hierarchical clustering in R.


```{r}
hc.complete <- hclust(dist(x), method="complete")
hc.average <- hclust(dist(x), method="average")
hc.single <- hclust(dist(x), method="single")
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(hc.complete,main="Complete Linkage", xlab="", sub="", cex=.9)
plot(hc.average, main="Average Linkage", xlab="", sub="", cex=.9)
plot(hc.single, main="Single Linkage", xlab="", sub="", cex=.9)
```

```{r}
cutree(hc.complete, 2)
```

```{r}
cutree(hc.average, 2)
```


```{r}
cutree(hc.single, 2)
```


```{r}
cutree(hc.single, 4)
```

To scale the variables before performing hierarchical clustering of the
observations, we use the scale() function:
```{r}
xsc=scale(x)
plot(hclust(dist(xsc), method="complete"), main="Hierarchical Clustering with Scaled Features")
```
