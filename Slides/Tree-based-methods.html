# Decision Trees

* Can be applied to both regression and classification problems. 

* Decision trees segment or stratify `\(X\)` variables (feature space) into simple and easily interpretable regions. The splitting or segmenting rules can be represented by a decision tree.  

* Given a new observation, the prediction is computed by checking the region that observation belongs.  

* An important drawback of decision trees is that it generally perform worse than other regression and classification methods.

* Solution: Use aggregation methods. These involve estimating a large number of trees and then aggregating them: e.g., bagging, random forests, and boosting.

# Stratification of feature space

Steps: 
1. Divide the predictor space, i.e., the set of possible values for `\(X_1, X_2,\ldots,X_p\)`, into `\(J\)` **distinct** and **non-overlapping** regions:
`\(R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_J\)`
1. For an observation that falls into region `\(R_j\)`, compute the prediction using the training mean in that region. 

Regions can be found by minimizing the following sum of squared residuals:
`$$\sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{i \in R_{j}}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{j}}\right)^{2}$$`
where  `\(\hat{y}_{R_{j}}\)` is the average in region `\(j\)`. Note that the feature space is divided into simple boxes.

* For simplicity, assume that there are two features, `\(X_1\)` and `\(X_2\)`. 
* We can split `\(x\)` values into sub-regions iteratively. 
* The cut-points that determine region boundaries can be found by solving the optimization problem. 
* Assume that the number of regions is 5.

# Building trees 

* Typically, a regression tree performs well in the training set, but not in the test set. 

* The reason for this is over-fitting. The resulting tree tends to be very large. 

* Solution: prune unnecessary branches and obtain a smaller tree which is more successful. Smaller tree = fewer leaves (terminal nodes).  

* Smaller trees tend to have bias but the variance is much smaller. 

* Pruning trees: 
  1. Start with a large tree 
  1. Select a subtree using cross-validation that gives the best test performance. 

* This strategy is not feasible because the number of subtrees tend to be very large.

---
# Pruning trees 

* Instead of that strategy, we can consider a set of trees indexed by a tuning parameter `\(\alpha\)` and consider the following objective function: 
`$$\sum_{m=1}^{|T|} \sum_{i: x_{i} \in R_{m}}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{m}}\right)^{2}+\alpha|T|$$`
where `\(|T|\)` is the number of leaves 

* `\(\alpha\)` parameter measures the trade-off between tree complexity and model's fit 
* When `\(\alpha=0\)`, we have the initial large tree, `\(T_0\)`. 

* As `\(\alpha\)` increases, tree becomes smaller (the number of leaves declines).

* The tuning parameter `\(\alpha\)` can be chosen by cross-validation.

# Classification trees

* Similar to regression trees algorithmically. 
* But now the response variable is categorical rather than continuous.  
* For each region (or node) we predict the **most common category** among the training data within that region.

# Measuring performance in classification trees

- The splits are chosen by minimizing classification error instead of minimizing SSR. 

- The **classification error rate** ( `\(E\)` ) is defined as
`$$E = 1-\max_k(\hat{p}_{mk})$$`
where `\(\hat{p}_{mk}\)` is the proportion of observations in region `\(m\)` and category `\(k\)` in the training set. 

- **Disadvantage**: `\(E\)` is not sensitive enough to grow trees. In practice, two alternative criteria are available:

  1. Gini index ( `\(G\)` )

  1. Entropi ( `\(D\)` )


---
# Classification performance criteria

.pull-left[
Gini index: 
`$$G = \sum_{k=1}^{K}  \hat{p}_{mk}(1-\hat{p}_{mk})$$`
Entropy: 
`$$D=-\sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{mk} \log(\hat{p}_{mk})$$`
]
.pull-right[
* Gini index is a measure of total variability in `\(K\)` classes 
* When `\(\hat{p}_{mk}\)` values are close to 0 or 1, `\(G\)` takes on small values. 
* For this reason, Gini index is also a measure of node purity. A small value implies that a node consists of observations predominantly from a single class 
* Similarly, the entropy measure also takes on small values when `\(\hat{p}_{mk}\)` is closer to 0 or 1.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Trees
.pull-left[
**Advantages** 
* Easy to explain and interpret. 
* Can be represented visually.
* Can be applied to both regression and classification problems
* Some believe that trees represent human-decision making proccess more successfully than other approaches  
* Categorical predictors can be added without the need to convert them into dummy variables. 
]
--
.pull-right[
**Disadvantages** 
* Prediction performance is generally worse than other regression and classification approaches. 
* A small change in data can lead to important changes in the trees 
* For example, if we split training data randomly into two parts and grow separate trees we may obtain completely different results (**high variance**).  
]
--

**Alternative**: 
Instead of growing a single tree, grow a large number of trees and then aggregate them: **Random Forests, Bagging, Boosting**

---
name: bagging

# Bagging (**B**ootstrap **Agg**regat**ing**)

* Trees tend to have high variance.  

* A way to reduce the variance is to grow a large number of trees and then aggregate them. 

* Bagging is a general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical learning method. It can be particularly useful in the context of decision trees.

* Bagging involves two parts: Bootstrapping (i.e., generating many training sets)
and averaging over bootstrapped samples

---
# Bagging

* Let's assume that we have an i.i.d. random sample,  `\((Z_1, Z_2,\ldots,Z_n)\)`, drawn from a population with mean `\(\mu\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`. Then, the variance of the sample average `\(\bar{Z}\)` will be `\(\sigma^2/n\)`. 
* In other words, taking the average (i.e., aggregating) reduces the variance. 
* Bagging works in a similar manner. In fact, it can be applied to any machine learning algorithm. 
* It works as follows: for `\(B\)` different training sets, estimate the prediction model for each: `\(\hat{f}^1(x), \hat{f}^2(x),\ldots,\hat{f}^B(x)\)`. Then take the average of all predictions
`$$\hat{f}_{avg} =\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \hat{f}^b(x)$$`
* Practical difficulty: we only have a single training data


---
# Bagging (**B**ootstrap **Agg**regat**ing**)
.pull-left[
* We can create different training sets using **bootstrap** method 
* Bootstrap Aggregating: Randomly draw (with replacement) a data set from the training data and estimate the model. Repeat `\(B\)` times and take the average: 
`$$\hat{f}_{bag} =\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \hat{f}^{*b}(x)$$`
* No pruning.

# Out-of-bag Error

* How can we estimate test error in the Bagging method? 

* It is possible to estimate the test error without cross-validation 

* When we apply Bootstrap to grow trees, approximately 2/3 of data will be used. The remaining 1/3 can be used as validation set 

* In each bootstrap iteration, the remaining one-third observations that are not used in training are known as  **out-of-bag (OOB)** observations.

---
# Out-of-bag Error

* We can use these OOB observations in estimating test error. This is called the **OOB error** (for regression problems OOB MSE; for classification problems OOB classification error) 

* We do not need to run a separate cross-validation analysis


* For each bootstrap iteration, the OOB error can be computed easily 

* For large `\(B\)` values, this approach produces results similar to leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)

# Variable importance measures

* Bagging generally improves prediction accuracy compared to a single tree 
* But the resulting model cannot be interpreted because it is a combination of a large number of trees. It cannot be represented by a tree 
* The practical problem is that we do not know which variables are important 

.pull-left[
* **Variable importance measures** can be used for this problem. 
* In regression trees, we can save the reduction in SSR coming from splits for each predictor and then take the average for all `\(B\)` trees. Large values indicate important variables.   
* In classification trees, we can use reductions in the Gini index

name: randomforests

# Random Forests 

* In bagging, we estimate a separate tree in each iteration. We use the same feature set (predictors) even though observations are different 

* Because of this, the resulting trees tend to be similar to each other. For example, when there is a single dominant predictor, that variable will appear in all trees.  

* The resulting trees and hence the predictions will be similar. In other words, the correlation among trees will be very high. 

* This leads to increased variance even after aggregation. 



---
# Random Forests 

* Random Forest method follows similar steps but attempts to reduce the correlation and variance (**de-correlating**) by using not all  `\(p\)` variables but a random subset `\(m\)`  

* More specifically, each time a split is made, a new random selection of, say `\(m\approx \sqrt{p}\)`,  `\(X\)` variables are used. 

* This implies that different sets of variables are considered a given split. 

* For example, we may use `\(X_1,X_3,X_5\)` variables in a given split while using `\(X_2,X_4\)` in another split ( for a set of `\(p=5\)` features). 

* Bagging is a special case of Random Forests. We obtain Bagging when `\(m=p\)` 

---
name: boosting 

# Boosting 

* Boosting is similar to Bagging and Random Forests. But trees are grown sequentially using the information in previous trees 

* Boosting does not use bootstrap sampling. The boosting algorithm is summarized in the next slide 

* There are 3 tuning parameters in the boosting algorithm:
  * `\(B\)` = number of trees. Big values may lead over-fitting. Chosen by cross-validation
  * Shrinkage parameter = `\(\lambda\)` controls learning rate. In practice, it can be set to 0.01 or 0.001
  * The number of nodes in trees = `\(d\)`. In pracitce it can be set to `\(d=1\)`.

# Boosting algorithm for regression trees (p. 323)

1. Set `\(\hat{f}(x)=0\)` and `\(r_i=y_i\)` for all `\(i\)` in the training set 
1. For `\(b=1,2,\ldots,B\)` repeat: 
  
  a. Fit a tree `\(\hat{f}^b\)` with `\(d\)` splits (i.e., `\(d+1\)` terminal nodes) 
  b. Update `\(\hat{f}(x)\)` by adding in a shrunken version of the new tree: 
  `$$\hat{f}(x) \leftarrow \hat{f}(x)+\lambda \hat{f}^{b}(x)$$`
  c. Update the residuals: 
  `$$r_{i} \leftarrow r_{i}-\lambda \hat{f}^{b}\left(x_{i}\right)$$`
1. Output the boosted model: 
`$$\hat{f}(x)=\sum_{b=1}^{B} \lambda \hat{f}^{b}(x)$$`
